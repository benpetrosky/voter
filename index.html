          You can vote!!!! Voting is one of the most important rights and responsibilities that U.S. citizens have. About 150 million American citizens are qualified to vote. Unfortunately, many don’t. They give up on a chance to choose leaders and representatives who will do things that are important to them. Why Vote? Nobody can force a citizen to vote. But many citizens do vote, because voting lets them tell the government what they want it to do. If citizens think they’re paying too many taxes, they can vote for a person who promises to lower taxes. If citizens want more services, they can vote for someone who will promise to spend funds to gain more services. Every Vote Counts

          Sorry, you can't vote yet! Volunteer for a campaign
          Is there a certain candidate you feel strongly towards? Sign up to volunteer for their campaign! You might not be old enough to work the polls, but there's usually no age limit on phone banking or other forms of spreading the word. Look on the website of the candidate you like and see how to start volunteering.
          Attend rallies
          Gather up some friends with similar views and go to a rally for your fave candidate. It's a great way to show support and be surrounded by people who share the same beliefs as you. Plus, you can get some awesome Snapchats of the event.
          Buy and wear merchandise
